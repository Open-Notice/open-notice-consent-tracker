Keep Track Of Your Consents 

## Do you remember what you've agreed to online?

Most of the time when we are asked to agree to a set of conditions or privacy policies online, most of us just tick the box and forget. But what if you could keep a record of everything you have agreed to?

The consent tracker is a cross-browser bookmarklet to help you keep track of all the online terms-of-service and privacy policies. You can store them locally, in a personal cloud or even send a copy to the organisation themselves for confirmation.
